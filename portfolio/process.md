Find two different sources that describe the data science pipeline or lifecycle. Write a blog style post that discusses their differences and hypothesizes about why they may be different? Are they for different audiences? Is one domain specific? How do they emphasize different modeling tasks?
Include a Recommendation for when you think each one is better
