# Process Level 3



## Process level 3


Process level 3 is a little different than most of the others.  You may be able
to work it into an analysis notebook, but likely, you'll need to do one of the
following.

### Data Science Pipeline Comparisons

Find two different sources that describe the data science pipeline or lifecycle. Write a blog style post that discusses their differences and hypothesizes about why they may be different? Are they for different audiences? Is one domain specific? How do they emphasize different modeling tasks?
Include a Recommendation for when you think each one is better

### Write a short story

Write a short story that explains the concepts of data science to demonstrate your
understanding of process.

### Media Review

Watch/listen/read to an episode of a high quality[^hq] podcast or other type of media
and write a blog style summary and review. Highlight what you learned and how it
relates to topics covered in class.
