# Deepening your knowledge

Completing the basic assignments that demonstrate you can apply what we cover in class to your own data, is enough for a B, to earn an A you need to extend your knowledge. 

You have some different pathways to earning an A. See the sections in the left menu for ideas.  



::::{attention}
Merge in all of your graded work and create a new PR in your portfolio. 
:::::


<!-- 
To submit these, submit the work to a separate `<assignment>extended` branch so for assignment 2 extension, submit to `assignment2extended`.

You should **not** extend *every* assignment since skills overlap and relate to one another. 

I recommend making an issue that is a plan and asking for feedback before you work on extensions, so that you do not do too much extra work.  -->

Some ideas:
- extend one task of A5 to have experiments that more carefully analyze and compare different models at a task for one of the ml tasks (classification, regression, clustering) and visualize and summarize
- transform your portfolio to a publish-able portfolio by making it a jupyter book (mostly set up already, just need to clean up)
- summarize the what you learned from a speaker
