# A7: Model Copmarison

due: 2025-11-20

## Instructions




```{tip}
this is best for regression or classification, but if you use clustering
use the `scoring` parameter to pass better metrics than the default
of the score method.
```

```{hint}
See the questions to consider in A9 for more detail on what to consider when optimizing each model. 

If you are skipping submitting A9, follow those instructions for each model. 
```

1. Choose a dataset, it can be appropriate for classification, regression, or clustering. 
1. Optimize at least two models for the same {term}`task` and choose the appropriate metrics to compare the fit. 
1. Decide which model you would recommend based on a realistic setting for that dataset and include evidence justifying that choice. 
1. Summarize your findings with plots and tables as appropriate.

:::::{tip}
Use the same data you have used for A5 and A6, and re-use your optimization from A6 and optimize a second model
