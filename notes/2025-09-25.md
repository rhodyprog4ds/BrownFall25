# Fixing values


# Fixing Values
o far, we've dealt with structural issues in data. but there's a lot more to
cleaning.  

Today,  we'll deal with how to fix the values within  the data.
## Cleaning Data review

Instead of more practice with these manipulations, below are more
examples of cleaning data to see how these types of manipulations get used.  
Your goal here is not to memorize every possible thing, but to build a general
idea of what good data looks like and good habits for cleaning data and keeping
it reproducible.  
- [Cleaning the Adult Dataset](https://ryanwingate.com/projects/machine-learning-data-prep/adult/adult-cleaning/)
- [All Shades](https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/foundation-names#allshadescsv--allshadesr)
Also here are some tips on general data management and organization.

This article is a comprehensive [discussion of data cleaning](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-data-cleaning-3969843991d4).

### A Cleaning Data Recipe

__not everything possible, but good enough for this course__


1. Can you use parameters to read the data in better?
1. Fix the index and column headers (making these easier to use makes the rest easier)
1. Is the data strucutred well?
1. Are there missing values?
1. Do the datatypes match what you expect by looking at the head or a sample?
1. Are categorical variables represented in usable way?
1. Does your analysis require filtering or augmenting the data?



## What is clean enough?

This is a great question, without an easy answer.

It depends on what you want to do.  This is why it's important to have potential
questions in mind if you are cleaning data for others *and* why we often have to
do a little bit more preparation after a dataset has been "cleaned"



**whatever you do, document it**

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np #
na_toy_df = pd.DataFrame(data = [[1,3,4,5],[2 ,6, np.nan, ], [np.nan ]*4])

# make plots look nicer and increase font size
sns.set_theme(font_scale=2, palette='colorblind')
arabica_data_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database/master/data/arabica_data_cleaned.csv'

coffee_df = pd.read_csv(arabica_data_url)


rhodyprog4ds_gh_events_url = 'https://api.github.com/orgs/rhodyprog4ds/events'
course_gh_df = pd.read_json(rhodyprog4ds_gh_events_url)
```


## Missing Dtaa

Dealing with missing data is a whole research area. There isn't one solution.

- [in 2020 there was a whole workshop on missing](https://artemiss-workshop.github.io/)
- one organizer is the main developer of [sci-kit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) the ML package we will use soon.  In a [2020 invited talk](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/ray2020/08/Keynote-%20Easier%20Machine%20Learning%20Thoughts%20From%20Scikit-Learn%20-%20Ga%C3%ABl%20Varoquaux%2C%20Research%20Director%2C%20Inria.pdf) he listed more automatic handling as an active area of research  and a development goal for sklearn.
- There are also many classic approaches both when training and when [applying models](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume8/saar-tsechansky07a/saar-tsechansky07a.pdf).
- [example application in breast cancer detection](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.701.4234&rep=rep1&type=pdf)



Even in pandas, dealing with [missing values](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html) is under [experimentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html#missing-data-na)
 as to how to represent it symbolically


Missing values causes the [datatypes to change](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html#missing-data-casting-rules-and-indexing)


We tend to store missing values as `NaN` or use the constants:

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.NA, np.nan
```

Pandas makes that a special typed object, but converts the whole *column* to float

Numpy uses *float* value for `NaN` that is defined by [IEEE floating point standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754)



Pandas gives a few basic tools for dealing with missing values :

- dropna
- fillna



```{code-cell} ipython3
type(pd.NA),type(np.nan)
```


````{admonition} Floats are weird

![float comic for jvns.ca](https://wizardzines.com/zines/integers-floats/samples/2-floating-point.png)

there are values that cannot be represented. 

- [see float.exposed for infinity ](https://float.exposed/0x7ff0000000000000)
-  [negative infinity](https://float.exposed/0xfff0000000000000)
- [see a nan](https://float.exposed/0x7ff8000000000000) (which bits can be changd without making it *not* nan)
- from [9007199254740992.0](https://float.exposed/0x4340000000000000)  the next closest value is [9007199254740994.0](https://float.exposed/0x4340000000000001)... no values in between can be stores in double precision float

````

:::{attention}
I expanded the table a bit to demo a little more than we saw in class here. 
:::::

We can see a few in this toy dataset 
```{code-cell} ipython3
na_toy_df
```


### Dropping Missing
Let's try the default behavior of `dropna`
```{code-cell} ipython3
na_toy_df.dropna()
```



by default it drops all of the *rows* where **any** of the elements are missing (1 or more)

This is equivalent to: 
```{code-cell} ipython3
na_toy_df.dropna(how='any', subset=na_toy_df.columns)
```


we can change `how` to its other mode: 



```{code-cell} ipython3
na_toy_df.dropna(how='all', )
```

in `'all'` mode it only drops rows where **all** of the values are missing

we can also change it to work along columns (`axis=1`) instead


```{code-cell} ipython3
na_toy_df.dropna(how='all',axis=1)
```

None of the columns are *all* missing so nothing is dropped

if only some of the columns, matter, we can say to only drop if any of those values are missing:

```{code-cell} ipython3
na_toy_df.dropna(subset=[0,1])
```
this means no drops, but if we change the important columns, it changes

```{code-cell} ipython3
na_toy_df.dropna(subset=[0,2],how='any')
```



### Filling 

Filling can be good if you know how to fill reasonably, but don't have data to
spare by dropping.  For example
- you can approximate with another column
- you can approximate with that column from other rows

Special case, what if we're filling a summary table?
- filling with a symbol for printing can be a good choice, but not for analysis.



```{code-cell} ipython3
toy_df_filled = na_toy_df.fillna(0)
toy_df_filled
```

::::::{note}
Simulated data or aother filling in values can only be done if you understand the data well, if you are trying to understand the world through the data, filling in simulated values, means the data is no longer about the world.  It is not about the simulation you used to fill in the values. 

Simulated data *can* be used responsibly for some things, but missing data is not generally one of them. 
::::::

### Filling missing values in the coffee data

Let's look at a real dataset now
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.info()
```

The 'Lot.Number' has a lot of NaN values, how can we explore it?

We can look at the type:

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Lot.Number'].dtype
```
And we can look at the value counts.
```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Lot.Number'].value_counts()
```


We see that a lot are '1', maybe we know that when the data was collected, if the Farm only has one lot, some people recorded '1' and others left it as missing. So we could fill in with 1:

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Lot.Number'].fillna('1').head()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Lot.Number'].head()
```


Note that even after we called `fillna` we display it again and the original data is unchanged.
To save the filled in column, *technically* we have a few choices:
- {fa}`fa-ban` use the `inplace` parameter. This doesn't offer performance advantages, but does It still copies the object, but then reassigns the pointer. Its under discussion to [deprecate](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/16529)
- {fa}`fa-check` write to a new DataFrame
- {fa}`fa-check` add a column


we will add a column

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['lot_number_clean'] = coffee_df['Lot.Number'].fillna('1')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.head(1)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.shape
```


## Dropping


Dropping is a good choice when you otherwise have a lot of data and the data is
missing at random.

Dropping can be risky if it's not missing at random. For example, if we saw in
the coffee data that one of the scores was missing for all of the rows from one
country, or even just missing more often in one country, that could bias our
results.  

here will will focus on how this impacts how much data we have: 

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.dropna().shape
```

we lose a lot this way.

We could instead tell it to only drop rows with `NaN` in a subset of the columns.

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df.dropna(subset=['altitude_low_meters']).shape
```


Now, it drops any row with one or more `NaN` values in that column.

In the [Open Policing Project Data Summary](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/) we saw that they made a summary information that showed which variables had at least 70% not missing values.  We can similarly choose to keep only variables that have more than a specific threshold of data, using the `thresh` parameter and `axis=1` to drop along columns.

```{code-cell} ipython3
n_rows, _ = coffee_df.shape
coffee_df.dropna(thresh=.7*n_rows, axis=1).shape
```


## Inconsistent values



This was one of the things that many of you anticipated or had observed.  A useful way to investigate for this, is to use `value_counts` and sort them alphabetically by the values from the original data, so that similar ones will be consecutive in the list. Once we have the `value_counts()` Series, the values from the `coffee_df` become the index, so we use `sort_index`.

Let's look at the `In.Country.Partner` column


```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['In.Country.Partner'].value_counts().sort_index()
```



We can see there's only one `Blossom Valley International\n` but 58 `Blossom Valley International`, the former is likely a typo, especially since `\n` is a special character for a newline. Similarly, with 'Specialty Coffee Ass' and 'Specialty Coffee Association'.

```{code-cell} ipython3
partner_corrections = {'Blossom Valley International\n':'Blossom Valley International',
  'Specialty Coffee Ass':'Specialty Coffee Association'}
coffee_df['in_country_partner_clean'] = coffee_df['In.Country.Partner'].replace(
  to_replace=partner_corrections)
coffee_df['in_country_partner_clean'].value_counts().sort_index()
```


## Multiple values in a single column
::::::{attention}
This is an extra type of fixing that we did not do in class
:::::::


Let's look at the column about the bag weights

```{code-cell} ipython3
coffee_df['Bag.Weight'].head()
```
it has both the *value* and the *units* in a single column, which is not what we want. 

This would be better in two separate columns

```{code-cell} ipython3
bag_df = coffee_df['Bag.Weight'].str.split(' ').apply(pd.Series).rename({0:'bag_weight_clean',
                                                                1:'bag_weight_unit'},
                                                              axis=1)
bag_df.head()
```

This:
- picks the column
- treats it as a string with the [pandas Series attribute `.str`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.str.html)
- uses [base python `str.split` ](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split)to split at `' '` spaces and makes a list
- casts each list to Series with `.apply(pd.Series)` 
- renames the resulting columns from being numbered to usable names `rename({0:'bag_weight_clean', 1:'bag_weight_unit'}, axis=1)`

````{tip}
The `.apply(pd.Series)` works on dictionaries too (anything hte [series constructor](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.html) can take to its `data` parameter) so this
is good for json data
````

The following subsections break down the casting and string methods in more detail
### String methods

Python has a powerful [string class](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods). There is also an even more powerful [`string` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html)


we only need the base `str` methods most of the time
```{code-cell} ipython3
example_str = 'kjksfjds sklfjsdl'
type(example_str)
```

Some helpful ones: 

```{code-cell} ipython3
example_str.split()
```

this gives a list

you can also change the separator

```{code-cell} ipython3
'phrases-with-hyphens'.split('-')
```

there are also mehtods for chaning the case and other similar things. **Use these* instead of implementing your own string operations!! 

```{code-cell} ipython3
example_str.upper(), example_str.capitalize()
```


## Combining parts of dataframes

```{code-cell} ipython3
bag_df.head()
```

we can pass `pd.concat` and iterable of pandas objects (here a `list` of `DataFrames`) and it will, by default stack them vertically, or with `axis=1` stack the horizontally

```{code-cell} ipython3
pd.concat([coffee_df,bag_df],axis=1)
```


### Casting Review

If we have a variable that is not the type we want like this:
```{code-cell} ipython3
a='5'
```


we can check type
```{code-cell} ipython3
type(a)
```

and we can use the name of the type we want, as a function to *cast* it to the new type. 

```{code-cell} ipython3
int(5)
```

and check 
```{code-cell} ipython3
type(int(a))
```


### json exmaple

:::::::{attention}
this will be filled in later
::::::::

```{code-cell} ipython3
course_gh_df.head(1)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
type(course_gh_df.loc[0])
```


```{code-cell} ipython3
course_gh_df['actor'].head(3)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
course_gh_df['actor'].apply(pd.Series).head(3)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
course_gh_df.head(1)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
json_cols = ['actor','repo','payload','org']

pd.concat([ course_gh_df[col].apply(pd.Series)
            for col in json_cols],axis=1).head(3)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
json_cols = ['actor','repo','payload','org']

course_gh_df_clean = pd.concat([ course_gh_df[col].apply(pd.Series).rename(lambda in_col: f'{col}_{in_col}',axis=1)
            for col in json_cols],axis=1)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
[col for col in course_gh_df.columns if not(col in json_cols)]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
json_cols = ['actor','repo','payload','org']

course_gh_df_clean = pd.concat([course_gh_df[[col for col in course_gh_df.columns if not(col in json_cols)]]]+
    [ course_gh_df[col].apply(pd.Series).rename(lambda in_col: f'{col}_{in_col}',axis=1)
            for col in json_cols],axis=1)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
course_gh_df_clean.head(3)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```

## Questions 

Today's questions were all about the assignment or json example.
