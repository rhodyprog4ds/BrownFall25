## What is Data Science?

Data Science is the combination of
![venn diagram of CS, Stats, & domain expertise with DS at the center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/rhodyds/main/img/ds_venn.png)


**statistics** is the type of math we use to make sense of data.
Formally, a statistic is just a function of data.

**computer science** is so that we can manipulate visualize and automate the inferences we make.

**domain expertise** helps us have the intuition to know if what we did worked
right. A statistic must be interpreted in context; the relevant context determines
what they mean and which are valid.  The context will say whether automating something
is safe or not, it can help us tell whether our code actually worked right or not.

### In this class,

![venn diagram of CS, Stats, & domain expertise with DS at the center, w/310 location marked](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/rhodyds/main/img/310_venn.png)

We'll focus on the programming as our main means of studying data science, but we will
use bits of the other parts.  In particular, you're encouraged to choose datasets that you
have domain expertise about, or that you want to learn about.

+++


But there are many definitions.  We'll use this one, but you may come across others.

+++


### How does data science happen?

The most common way to think about what doing data science means is to think of this pipeline.  It is in the perspective of the data, these are all of the things that happen to the data.

![DS pipeline: collect, clean, explore, model, deploy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/rhodyds/main/img/process.png)

+++


Another way to think about it

![DS process: 3 major phases (prepare,build,finish) with many sub-phases. Prepare:set goals, explore, wrangle, assess; Build: Plan, analyze, engineer, optimize, execute; Finish: Deliver, revise, wrap up](https://drek4537l1klr.cloudfront.net/godsey/Figures/01fig02_alt.jpg)

### how we'll cover Data Science, in depth


![DS pipeline: collect, clean, explore, model, deploy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/rhodyds/main/img/process_course.png)

- *collect*: Discuss only a little; Minimal programming involved
- *clean*: Cover the main programming techniques; Some requires domain knowledge beyond scope of course
- *explore*: Cover the main programming techniques; Some requires domain knowledge beyond scope of course
- *model*:Cover the main programming, basic idea of models; How to use models, not how learning algorithms work
- *deploy*: A little bit at the end, but a lot of preparation for decision making around deployment


+++



### how we'll cover it in, time

![DS pipeline: collect, clean, explore, model, deploy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/rhodyds/main/img/process_course_time.png)

We'll cover exploratory data analysis before cleaning because those tools will help us check how we've cleaned the data.

## How this class will work

**Participatory Live Coding**


+++

What is a topic you want to use data to learn about?

+++


```{note}
Here I changed this title from the title of the notebook, to a subsection but the rest of this is what was actually done in class, with explanation. 
```
## Intro to Jupyter Notebooks


## Programming for Data Science vs other Programming

The audience is different, so the form is different.

In Data Science our product is more often a report than a program.

+++

Sometimes there will be points in the notes that were not made in class due to time or in response questions that came at the end of class.

+++

Also, in data science we are *using code* to interact with data, instead of having a plan in advance



+++



So programming for data science is more like *writing* it has a narrative flow and is made to be seen more than some other programming thaat you may have done.

## Jupyter Lab and Jupyter notebooks

Launch a [`jupyter lab` server](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):
- on Windows, use anaconda terminal
- on Mac/Linux, use terminal
- `cd path/to/where/you/save/notes`
- enter `jupyter lab`



### What just happened?


- launched a local web server
- opened a new browser tab pointed to it

![a diagram depicting a terminal window launching a local web server that reports back to the terminal and serves jupyter in the browser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhodyprog4ds/rhodyds/main/img/jupyter_notebook_running.svg)




### A jupyter notebook tour




A Jupyter notebook has two modes. When you first open, it is in command mode. It says the mode in the bottom right of the screen. Each bos is a cell, the highlighted cell is gray when in command mode. 


When you press a key in command mode it works like a shortcut. For example `p` shows the command search menu.

If you press `enter` (or `return`)  or click on the highlighted cell, which is the boxes we can type in,  it changes to edit mode.


There are two type of cells that we will used: code and markdown. You can change that in command mode with `y` for code and `m` for markdown or on the cell type menu at the top of the notebook.




This is a markdown cell
- we can make
- itemized lists of
- bullet points

1. and we can make nubmered
2. lists, and not have to worry
3. about renumbering them
4. if we add a step in the middle later

## Jupyter Introduction
*hello*

**bold**

can you read this

+++


```{code-cell} ipython3
5+4
```

the output here is the value returned by the python interpretter for the last line of the cell

We can set variables
```{code-cell} ipython3
name = 'sarah'
```
The notebook displays nothing when we do an assignment, bcause it returns nothing


we can put a variable there to see it 
```{code-cell} ipython3
name
```

## Getting Help


```{note}
built in functions turn green in jupyter
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# this is a bad idea
# help = 'use the help function'
```
::::{warning}
In class, we ran the code above, but if I uncomment it here, it will run when the website builds
:::::

```{code-cell} ipython3
help(print)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print.__doc__
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(name)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
major='EE'
```

Modify the following code so that it prints out the two things on separate lines

`print(name,major)`

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(name,major)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(name,major,sep='\n')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```

```{code-cell} ipython3

```
